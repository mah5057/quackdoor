# PYTHON PAYLOAD - WRITE THE CODE TO EGGSECUTE HERE
#
# breadcrumbs:
#   - python3
#   - can install non-standard libraries, but you will 
#     have to tweak the sleep value in hatch.py to allow
#     enough time for the target shell to install the
#     dependencies before moving on to running the code.
#   - smaller is better
#   - less external dependencies is better
